  prioserver:
    # This service is the main server service in that it is responsible for
    # database migrations, adding the initial user credentials etc.  However,
    # the direct access to this service's resources is only granted to select,
    # prioritized OpenSlides users or groups.  The general workload is handled
    # by the regular "server" service below.
    # It will share all the same resources (DB, Redis, static files)
    # as the regular server, so it is crucial that it is always kept at
    # compatible versions.
